# Data-Processing-and-Analysis

The Data Processing component of the repository is organized into two main subfolders, corresponding to the two primary imagined speech datasets supported by the toolbox.

**NATO Alphabet Data Processing**

The NATO alphabet processing folder focuses on quantitative decoding and classification approaches, including both classical and modern machine learning techniques.
Key components include:
•	Riemannian Geometry Based Methods:
o	Feature extraction based on covariance matrices.
o	Classification approaches operating on the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices.
o	Baseline and comparative pipelines suitable for low sample, high dimensional EEG data.
•	Deep Learning Approaches:
o	Neural network architectures tailored to time series EEG data.
o	End to end learning pipelines for imagined speech classification.
o	Configurable training and evaluation scripts enabling systematic experimentation.
Together, these methods support rigorous performance evaluation and benchmarking across different decoding paradigms.

**English–Greek Data Processing**

The English–Greek processing folder emphasizes qualitative and exploratory analyses, aimed at understanding neurophysiological differences across languages and imagined speech conditions.
Included analyses comprise:
•	Topographic Maps (Topoplots): Visualization of spatial activation patterns across the scalp.
•	Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis: Frequency domain characterization of imagined speech related EEG activity.
•	Additional EEG Related Metrics: Time domain and frequency domain descriptors supporting qualitative comparison between conditions and languages.
These analyses provide interpretability and neurophysiological insight, complementing the quantitative decoding approaches applied to the NATO alphabet dataset.
